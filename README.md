# SodaCityBitburnerAscii
A looping terminal ascii animation of the Soda City Funk music video (no music sadly).

To use this code just copy and paste and save it in a bitburner ns2 script (.js) and run it from terminal.
The "frames" varialbe determines the speed of the animation, currently set at 40 and doesn't like being exceeded.
